Taking entry for components:
    - should say what kind of component it is on the top of window (with an identifier ie R1, R2 ect)
        - this identifier will require a class attribute 
    - whatever is entered to this field should update the components 'controlled value'
        - certain values cannot be directly controlled (you cannot set the voltage of a resistor directly, this is a function of the current and the resistance)
    - should display the other values at the bottom of the window (voltage/ current through resistor)


MAKE A circuit analysis module class
    - all parallel components have the same voltage
    - all series components have the same current



circuit analysis:
    - should probably make funcionality to identify loops
ohms_law()
voltage_division()
kvl()
kcl()
