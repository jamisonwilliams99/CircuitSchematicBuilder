Point:
- loc: (int, int)   # screen coordinates
- grid_loc: (int, int)  # grid coordinates
- restricted: boolean

Grid:
- pts: dictionary (with Point objects)
- components: dictionary(with component objects)


Wire:
- start_pt: Point
- end_pt: Point
- pts: list of Points
- draw()

Component:
- center_pt: Point
- orientation: string
- restricted_points: list of points
- two terminal objects

Resistor: derived from Component
- draw()
- resistance: int



Node: 
- wires: list of wire objects
- components: list of components it connects

Terminal:
- component: the component object that the terminal is attached to
- node: the node (collection of wire objects) that the terminal connects the component to
- pt: point where the terminal is (will be on the end of a component)
- will be nested in the component class
