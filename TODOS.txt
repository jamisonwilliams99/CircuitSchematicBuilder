1. remove ability to create diagnol lines DONE
    - idea: possibly add functionality to draw two lines if user tries to create a diagnol line??? DONE

2. Add draw resistor function
     - also it will likely be necessary to create a class for each component
     - each class will inherit from component class
     - also need to remove ability to place a resistor near another resistor DONE
     - need to remove ability to place wire through resistor DONE
     - need to remove ability to place resistor on a wire CURRENT TASK
     - add ability to rotate resistor

3. add functionality where after the first mouse click, it follows your cursor
   and redraws a new line depending on where your cursor is

4. add ability to delete selected wire segments
    - will require a wire class (anything that is placed on grid will likely need its own class)



FUTURE IDEAS
1. short/open circuit detection
2. solve unknowns (such as voltage across resistor)
