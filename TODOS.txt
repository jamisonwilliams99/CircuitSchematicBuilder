FUTURE IDEAS
1. short/open circuit detection
2. solve unknowns (such as voltage across resistor)
3. allow components to detect series or paralell connections to other components
    - parallel = two components are connected to the same 2 nodes

4. add function to hide grid dots
5. add abililty to save schematic as image


KNOWN BUGS
- when the light mode is changed while components are placed, the components stay the same color
- the display wires will occasionally generate a random wire that goes away after selecting another point
- when the user places a corner wire that is long (start point is far from the end point) the wire display is slow because
- the dist(fucntion takes longer to calculate. This makes it laggy
    - could avoid the dist function altogether

current tasks:
- give all classes string representation methods
- rewrite the make connections method 
- generalize more of the component methods (a lot of methods in resistor are repeated in VoltageSource)
- make a decorator for the place_resistor and place_source methods in main (they are pretty much the same)


Classes to make:
    - Node
    - Terminal



It might help optimize my code if I replace some frequently searched lists with sets
